Kanha National Park, located in the Mandla and Balaghat districts of Madhya Pradesh, is one of India’s most renowned wildlife sanctuaries and a premier tiger reserve under Project Tiger. Spanning over vast sal forests, grasslands, and bamboo groves, the park is famous for its rich biodiversity and is believed to have inspired Rudyard Kipling’s “The Jungle Book.” Known as the heart of India’s wilderness, Kanha offers one of the best opportunities to spot Bengal tigers in their natural habitat along with barasingha (swamp deer), leopards, wild dogs, and numerous bird species.

The sanctuary is divided into core zones such as Kanha, Kisli, Mukki, and Sarhi, each offering unique safari experiences through dense forests and open meadows. The park’s conservation success is globally recognized, especially for saving the hard-ground barasingha from near extinction. Tourists can enjoy thrilling jeep safaris, nature walks, birdwatching, and guided wildlife tours led by trained forest experts. The scenic landscapes, misty meadows, and serene environment make it a paradise for wildlife photographers and nature enthusiasts.
